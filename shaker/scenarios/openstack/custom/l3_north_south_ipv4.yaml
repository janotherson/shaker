title: OpenStack L3 North-South Performance

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches 1 pair of instances on different compute
  nodes. Instances are in different networks connected to different routers,
  primary accesses minion by floating ip. The traffic goes from one network
  via external network to the other network.

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south_ipv4.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, cross_az, density: 1, compute_nodes: 2]
