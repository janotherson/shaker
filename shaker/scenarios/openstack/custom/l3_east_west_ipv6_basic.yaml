title: OpenStack L3 East-West Cross-AZ IPv6

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances, each instance on its own
  compute node. Instances are connected to one of 2 networks, which plugged
  into single router. The traffic goes from one network to the other
  (L3 east-west using IPv6).
  The primary and minion instances are in different availability zones.

deployment:
  template: l3_east_west_ipv6.hot
  env_file: shaker_common.env
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, cross_az, density: 1, compute_nodes: 2]
