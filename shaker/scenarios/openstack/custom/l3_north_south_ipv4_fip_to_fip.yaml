title: OpenStack L3 East-West FIP-to-FIP dense test

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances.
  Instances are connected to different tenant networks connected to one
  router. The traffic goes from one network to the other (L3 FIP-to-FIP).

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south_ipv4_fip_to_fip.hot
