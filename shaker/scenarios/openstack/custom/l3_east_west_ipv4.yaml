title: OpenStack L3 East-West Cross-AZ IPv4

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances, each instance on its own
  compute node. Instances are connected to one of 2 tenant networks, which
  plugged into single router. The traffic goes from one network to the other
  (L3 east-west).
  The primary and minion instances are in different availability zones.
  The scenario is used to test throughput between `nova` and `vcenter` zones.
